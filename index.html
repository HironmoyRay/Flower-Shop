            <h1>Let's make beautiful flowers a part of your life.</h1>
            <p>The perfume of your body dulls my sense.
                I want nor wine nor weed; your breath alone
                Suffices. In this moment rare and tense
                I worship at your breast. The flower is blown,
                The saffron petals tempt my amorous mouth,
                The yellow heart is radiant now with dew
                Soft-scented, redolent of my loved South;
                O flower of love! I give myself to you.</p>

                <h2>Our Featured Flowers</h2>
                <p>Plants are multicellular eukaryotes. They have organelles called chloroplasts and cell walls made of
                    cellulose. Plants also have specialized reproductive organs. Almost all plants make food by
                    photosynthesis. Life as we know it would not be possible without plants.</p>
